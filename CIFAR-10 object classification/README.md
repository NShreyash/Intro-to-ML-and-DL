# CIFAR-10-Object-Recognition-using-ResNet50
In this project, we built an object recognition system using the CIFAR-10 dataset. By leveraging the power of **ResNet50** and **transfer learning**, we achieved high classification accuracy. The dataset, consisting of 50,000 images categorized into 10 classes, was directly retrieved using the Kaggle API and preprocessed using NumPy and PIL libraries. The final model demonstrated excellent performance with a 94% test accuracy.

This repository has a Jupyter Notebook file with the code for the model trained <br/>
**To run the model in Google Colab**
- Generate your API token from your Kaggle account settings and place the `kaggle.json` file in the root directory of the project.
- Run section **1**of the code in the Jupyter Notebook to download the data in the Google Colab workspace to get going.
